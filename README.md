# Bookshelf
The idea behind Bookshelf was simply to gather web dev/design resources that are authoritative, comprehensive and  regarded as the best "go to" resources for the topic in question that will stand the test of time. I'll be linking to:

- eBooks published online
- Long form articles
- Official documentation
- Complete references/cheat sheets
